Mrs. Mary Wood Swift,
State Regent, Daughters of Am. Revolution,
824 Valencia St., San Francisco, Cal.
Dear Madam:
Your letter of the 20th inst. to Mr. Chas. G. Lathrop has been
referred to me for answer. On yesterday morning I wrote to Mrs. William
B. Carr, regent of Sequoia Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion, in response to her request, indicating that a reservation of four
seats would be made for a representation of this organization at Mrs. Stan-
ford's funeral on Friday next. I assume that your request covers the
same ground. In case the delegation can be limited to three, I should be
glad to be informed of this as the pressure on the seating capacity in the
church is very great. As the time is getting short, while notifying me
of the names and official positions of your committee, kindly also notify
the members that they are requested to report their presence on the Campus
at Room 55 in the inner Quadrangle, the building just east of the Church,
before one o'clock on the day of the funeral, from which place they will be
escorted to their seats in the Church. The exercises will begin promptly
at 1:30.
Very truly yours,
Chairman of Committee

Dear Sir:
My Father -
Thos. B. McFarland - will not
be able to act as a pallbearer
at Mrs. Stanford's funeral.
He is still confined to his
bed from a recent and serious
operation, and we cannot
even tell him of your note.
I thought best to answer,
