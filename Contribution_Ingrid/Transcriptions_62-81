Dear Dr. Jordan:

I learned from the papers that it will be necessary to have tickets
to enter the chapel at the burial exercises of Mrs. Stanford. If this be
the case and you can spare the tickets, I would be very much obliged to you for a couple. However, I do not want you to put yourself out in the matter or send them to me if there are others who are more entitled to have them.

Thanking you kindly for past favors, and with kind regards, I remain,

Cordially Yours,
L. P. Behrens

Prof Duniway,

This afternoon Mr John T Doyle,
Menlo Park came to the library
to see if he could arrange for
two tickets ("one for himself & one
for daughter") for Mrs Stanford's funeral.

No amount of suggestion
could induce him to make his
application to the president's office.
Mr Nash had once written him
that at the library he was to have
all the privileges of a member of
the faculty therefore the library
was of course the instrument
through which he was to obtain

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Untitled Page 76

the same or similar privilege
on this occasion.

Finally I promised to refer
his request to "Dr Duniway, who
is a personal friend of mine and
the papers say has something to
do with seating people." He would
like to sit with the University
faculty and close to the front, as
he is somewhat deaf. He would
desire to have the tickets or what
ever is required, sent to him
at Menlo Park.

I am sorry to be the in-
strument through which such
an irregular request comes at
this busy time. But if you

know Mr Doyle at all, you know that
the first person he comes to is the one
who must carry it through - there is
no passing on to one who knows. One
can not make promises to a feeble old
man and then forget it - and I promised
to forward his request.

Sincerely
L. P. Green

SAN FRANCISCO, [/preprinted] March 21, 1905.

Professor C. A. Duniway,

Stanford University, Calif.,

Dear Professor Duniway; I have written to the several representatives of different Stanford Clubs, and to the honorary pall bearers for the Stanford Club of S. F., as you suggested, telling the former to be in room 50 Quad., and the latter, in room 90, Quad, before 1 P. M. of Friday, 24th inst. I presume there will be somebody there to direct them.

It is hard to say how many Stanford people will go from S. F. to the funeral, but I will now ask that space for 100, instead of 50 be reserved, and, if we do not take it all, it will be a simple matter to count how many gather at the law library, and make arrangements then to give up some space, if one hundred have not gathered. I have no way of being certain. There may be less, there may be more, than 100. I have ordered postals printed directing them to go to the law library, as you suggested.

Very sincerely,

J. F. English
